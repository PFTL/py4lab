# Python for the Lab

This repository is the companion code for my book Python for the Lab, that you can find [here](gum.co/kgssv). It is also greatly based on what I write at [Python for the Lab](https://www.pythonforthelab.com/), and is what I follow when organizing [Python for the Lab workshops](https://www.pythonforthelab.com/courses/).

If you find this code useful, have any comments, or would simply like to contact me, just drop me an e-mail to: **aquiles@pythonforthelab.com**

## How this Repository is Organized

Each folder represents a chapter of the book in its final state. This means, when you complete Chapter 03, for example, your code should look similar to what you have in the folder **ch_03**. If, for some reason you skip some chapters, you can always get the code from the previous. If you want to build a GUI and jump the Chapter 8, for instance, just grab the code as it is in Chapter 7. 

There is one extra folder called **ch_future**, which points to an [external repository](https://github.com/PFTL/pythonforthelab). It is an example of how your program could keep evolving after you finish the book. It includes a lot of details not covered previously, such as documentation, and installation scripts. It is a great way of learning what's next in the roadmap of a successful Python developer. 

## How to Contribute
If you find any bugs in the code, you can always open an [Issue](https://github.com/PFTL/py4lab/issues), you can [contact me](https://github.com/aquilesC/), or create a [pull request](https://github.com/PFTL/py4lab/pulls). I strongly suggest you to check with me before diving into coding. Some things are "wrong" because of pedagogical purposes, and they must be on-pair with the book. 

## License of the Code
The code is licensed under MIT, see [LICENSE](./LICENSE) for more information. You are basically free to do what you want with the code, also including commercial applications, but you can't hold me liable for its output. 

If you build anything on the code, it would be great to hear it out. I know some universities are using the examples in their own courses and I do believe that collectively we can build much better tools than individually, especially for learning purposes.
